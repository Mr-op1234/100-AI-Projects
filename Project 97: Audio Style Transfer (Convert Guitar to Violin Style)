Description:
This project applies audio style transfer, where you convert the timbre or "style" of one instrument (e.g., guitar) into another (e.g., violin), while keeping the underlying melody or rhythm intact. It's like neural style transfer for sound.

Goal
Convert a musical performance from one instrument to sound like it's played on another, using deep learning models for timbral translation (e.g., CycleGANs or diffusion models for audio).

Code (Concept Prototype using MelGAN + timbre encoder)
import torch
import torchaudio
import torchaudio.transforms as T
 
# Load a sample guitar audio
waveform, sr = torchaudio.load("data/guitar_phrase.wav")
waveform = waveform[:, :sr * 3]  # take 3 seconds
 
# Preprocessing: Convert to mel-spectrogram
mel_transform = T.MelSpectrogram(sample_rate=sr, n_mels=80)
mel = mel_transform(waveform).squeeze(0)
 
# Load a pretrained MelGAN vocoder for waveform reconstruction
melgan = torch.hub.load("descriptinc/melgan-neurips", "load_melgan")
melgan.eval()
 
# Style transfer placeholder: Guitar ‚ûù Violin
# In a real pipeline, use CycleGAN trained on paired guitar-violin Mel spectrograms
def fake_style_transfer(mel):
    return mel.roll(shifts=5, dims=1) * 0.95  # Dummy shift to simulate spectral coloring
 
# Apply fake "style conversion"
mel_violin = fake_style_transfer(mel).unsqueeze(0)
 
# Reconstruct waveform from Mel spectrogram (MelGAN expects log-mel)
waveform_out = melgan.inverse(mel_violin)
 
# Save or play the output
torchaudio.save("outputs/violinified_guitar.wav", waveform_out, sr)
print("üéª Saved output as violin-styled guitar audio.")
For real style transfer, use:

CycleGAN trained on paired guitar/violin spectrograms

Diffusion models or AutoVC-like frameworks for fine-grained control

Datasets like NSynth (for individual instrument tone
